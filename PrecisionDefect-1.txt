1. Even if the appointment status is completed, system is not allowing to request another appointment.
	-- We need to add a check to see if the appointment status is completed or not.

2. Login functionality is not working
	-- We need to implement login functionality. 


3. Appointment can be booked of past time.
	-- We need to check the timing of the appointment system should not be less than now()

4. Alt Phone Number is mandatory
	-- This should not be a mandatory field

5. Alt Phone Number and Phone Number is asking to be different, which is wrong.
	-- This can be same as well 

6. User is not allowed to enter with different phone number but existing email.
	-- If the existing email/phone is used and it has appointment which is complete then also it should allow but proper message should be displayed to user. 

@7. In Search appoint and status window it is searching for invalid phone number as well.	
	-- There should be a check on UI itself that no invalid phone number should be allowed.

8. The message on Career page is not correct. Please update in for View Current Openings.

@9. Contact form is not working. This needs to be updated. 

@10. In-correct login credentials is not displayed as error. 

11. To Logout we have to press twice, once is just populating to Login page and not logging out. 



FUture Enhancement:

1. Once you are logged in, then the details should be auto-populated in Service at home section, you dont have to fill again -- This is not happening by default, hence no use of Login.

2. There should be Admin login which should populate appointment page so that you can change the status. 

3. An appointment can be added/deleted by the user who has logged in for his created appointment. 

4. Contact/Service at home should trigger mail 
	- Contact should trigger mail to Sales@precisionitsolution.com
	- Service should trigger mail to precisionitsolution@outlook.com and sales@precisionitsolution.com

5. All the email id on website should be changed to sales@precisionitsolution.com

6. Header should be present on all the page i.e. it should be called. 

7. A mail should be triggered to email id provided by user while booking appointment with appointment id and details
