1. Even if the appointment status is completed, system is not allowing to request another appointment.
	-- We need to add a check to see if the appointment status is completed or not.

2. Login functionality is not working
	-- We need to implement login functionality. 


@3. Appointment can be booked of past time.
	-- We need to check the timing of the appointment system should not be less than now()

@4. Alt Phone Number is mandatory
	-- This should not be a mandatory field

@5. Alt Phone Number and Phone Number is asking to be different, which is wrong.
	-- This can be same as well 

6. User is not allowed to enter with different phone number but existing email.
	-- If the existing email/phone is used and it has appointment which is complete then also it should allow but proper message should be displayed to user. 

7. In Search appoint and status window it is searching for invalid phone number as well.	
	-- There should be a check on UI itself that no invalid phone number should be allowed.
